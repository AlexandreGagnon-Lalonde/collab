## Mission
We aim to build a functional and well-presented web-based app, with an emphasis on maintaining a respectful, collaborative environment. Our group presents opportunities for members to learn and teach, whether in programming/tools or other parts of the project, such as organization and design. And most importantly... we want to have fun!

## Community guidelines
- Exercise mutual respect
- Everyone is invited to contribute, regardless of their level of experience – don’t be afraid to make mistakes and ask questions!
- You can commit to as much or as little work as you want – but please respect the time of your fellow teammates and honour commitments to the best of your ability
- Communication: Join our [slack group](https://join.slack.com/t/collab-centre/shared_invite/zt-izqi8c7p-qzOXc48kkdQDXfpCPmtIZA)

Note: If you have a specific problem that does not involve everyone, don’t spam – create a separate slack channel or talk directly to the contributor.

## Contributing
Are you ready to start collaborating? Head to our [Trello board](https://trello.com/b/1ujX8BDZ/collab) and pick up a task.


## Suggestion for app structure
 - frontend: this is where the Next.js app will live
 - backend: this is where the GraphQL server will live

Each section of the app can be it's own separate unit, all things FE will be in the `frontend` and nothing but `frontend`,
 and the same goes for the `backend` folder.

The main benefit I see for this is that I find in organized :) and if we decide to host each part on a different platform, it's easier because they are already separated
