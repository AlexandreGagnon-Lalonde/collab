- Exercise mutual respect
- Everyone is invited to contribute, regardless of their level of experience – don’t be afraid to make mistakes and ask questions!
- You can commit to as much or as little work as you want – but please respect the time of your fellow teammates and honour commitments to the best of your ability
- Communication: Join our [slack group](https://join.slack.com/t/collab-centre/shared_invite/zt-izqi8c7p-qzOXc48kkdQDXfpCPmtIZA)

Note: If you have a specific problem that does not involve everyone, don’t spam – create a separate slack channel or talk directly to the contributor.
